    <h2>Description</h2>
    
    <p>I have been making this recipe for over 20 years. This can be served over either rice or noodles. A little work but worth the effort.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>2 pounds beef chuck roast </li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt </li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper </li>
        <li>4 ounces butter </li>
        <li>4 green onions, sliced (white parts only) </li>
        <li>4 tablespoons all-purpose flour </li>
        <li>1 (10.5 ounce) can condensed beef broth </li>
        <li>1 teaspoon prepared mustard </li>
        <li>1 (6 ounce) can sliced mushrooms, drained </li>
        <li>⅓ cup sour cream </li>
        <li>⅓ cup white wine </li>
        <li>salt to taste </li>
        <li>ground black pepper to taste </li>
        
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Remove any fat and gristle from the roast and cut into strips 1/2 inch thick by 2 inches long. Season with 1/2 teaspoon of both salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>In a large skillet over medium heat, melt the butter and brown the beef strips quickly, then push the beef strips off to one side. Add the onions and cook slowly for 3 to 5 minutes, then push to the side with the beef strips.</li>
        <li>Stir the flour into the juices on the empty side of the pan. Pour in beef broth and bring to a boil, stirring constantly. Lower the heat and stir in mustard. Cover and simmer for 1 hour or until the meat is tender.</li>
        <li>Five minutes before serving, stir in the mushrooms, sour cream, and white wine. Heat briefly then salt and pepper to taste.</li>
        
    </ol>
